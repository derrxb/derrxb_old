For 2000 years the Ancient Maya lived in the city of Cahal Pech and its periphery.
Visiting Cahal Pech made we wonder about what our story will be 2000 years from now.
With these images, I wanted to capture the awe of such a thought I experienced on my visit.

Honestly, this is one of my favorite photo sets that I've shot. I love the location because
it has so much history and it is so close to home. The sunset light made everything 1000x more insane.
My favorite show is the silhouette of [Nico](https://www.instagram.com/nico.ssuave/).
