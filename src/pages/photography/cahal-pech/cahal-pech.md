Cahal Pech is one of the oldest Maya cities in Belize. People first settled there around 1200 B.C. That is mind-blowing!

Yet, despite its age, it wasn't until about 2 years ago that I visited the site for the first time. This is surprising because I've lived in San Ignacio all my life and Cahal Pech is about 20 minutes away from my house (Don't worry, I've visited multiple times now).

This set is from a photo shoot I had with my friend [Nico](https://www.instagram.com/nico.ssuave/). So there is a mix of the beautiful scenery and portraits.
