For 2000 years the Ancient Maya lived in the city of Cahal Pech and its periphery. Visiting Cahal Pech made we wonder about what our story will be 2000 years from now. With these images, I wanted to capture the awe of such a thought I experienced on my visit.

My favorite is the picture of my friend Nico looking up towards the top of this temple in awe.

This set is from a photo shoot I had with my friend [Nico](https://www.instagram.com/nico.ssuave/). So there is a mix of the beautiful scenery and portraits.
