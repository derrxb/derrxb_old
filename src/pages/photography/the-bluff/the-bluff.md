[The Bluff](https://www.instagram.com/thebluffsbz/) is an amazing restaurant located in the Cayo District. They have two of my favorite things: food and epic sunsets. I had never been to The Bluff before this shoot. My friend mentioned the place to me a few times though. Because of this, I was super stoked when Gaby asked me to do a shoot there.

The shoot was set up by Gaby for The Bluff. We also got a model named Gaby. So that was cool.
