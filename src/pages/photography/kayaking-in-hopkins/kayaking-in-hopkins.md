Nico and I decided to kayak from [Hopkins Bay Resort](https://www.hopkinsbaybelize.com/) to a lagoon that is located behind Hopkins village. The crazy thing is that to get to the lagoon we had to kayak through the sea for about 10 minutes. It was insane because we had our camera gear! (This was super silly so I definitely don't recommend that you do it.)

In the end, it was totally worth it. Here are some shots I took while at the lagoon.
