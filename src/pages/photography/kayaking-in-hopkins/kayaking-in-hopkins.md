Nico and I decided to kayak from [Hopkins Bay Resort](https://www.hopkinsbaybelize.com/) to a
lagoon that is located behind Hopkins village. The crazy thing is that to get to the lagoon we
had to kayak through the sea for about 10 minutes. It was insane because we had our camera gear!
This was super silly so I definitely don't recommend that you do it. But you should totally visit
that lagoon if you love kayaking.

In the end, it was totally worth it. While kayaking a barracuda jumped out and landed on me. It
was such a crazy experience and my friend laughed so much while I freaked out about what just happened.
Here are some shots I took while at the lagoon.
