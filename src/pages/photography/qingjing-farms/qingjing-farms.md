Qingjing Farm in Nantou, County is one of my favorite places I've visted in Taiwan so farm. The highlights of the
farm is definitely the amazing cloud formations, the sheep, and the skywalk. Unfortunately, we got there too late so
we were unable to do the skywalk. So I definitely want to return to the farm to get the full experientce.

Nantou country.
