I have an ongoing joke about being sponsored by Taiwan Beer. This is because everytime we go somewhere we would take
Taiwan Beer with us! Haha I think it's a great beer and it super refreshing after a hike/run/etc. So far Taiwan Beer is
my favorite beer in Taiwan. Also, this isn't sponsored or anything. It would be cool if it was though.
