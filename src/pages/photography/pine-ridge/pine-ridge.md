Mountain Pine Ridge (MPR) is one of my favorite places in Belize. Hopefully these photos help you see why that's the case.
A dream of mine is to go back there with some friends and explore Big Rock Waterfalls and mountain bike around. Most of the times
I've been to Mountain Pine Ridge has been during the day with harsh light. I'd love to visit and shoot for sunset.
