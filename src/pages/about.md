## Hi! I'm Derr 👨‍💻 📷 ‍

I'm a *software developer* and *photographer* based in San Ignacio, Belize. I build things and take pictures. I'm 21 years old and have spent my entire life in Belize so far. I attended Galen University where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I currently work at [**Belizing.com**](https://belizing.com) as a software developer. However, I'm moving to Hsinchu, Taiwan at the ending of August to further my studies at NTHU. I'm gonna be a graduate student in their IMPISA program.

In my free time, I like to roam around Belize and capture moments. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have a wonderful little Siamese cat, *Lola* 🐈 (I also enjoy taking pictures of her too).

You can find me online on my handle ***@derrxb***. But here are a few links that you might be interested in:
