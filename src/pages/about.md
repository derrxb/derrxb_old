## Hi, I'm Derr

I'm a **software engineer** and **photographer**. I was born in 1997 in the small and beautiful country of Belize.
I attended Galen University where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I currently work at **Belizing.com** as a software developer. In my free time, I like to roam around Belize and capture moments. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography.

While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have two wonderful creatures that depend on me: my Siamese cat, *Lola* 🐈 and my dog *Ace* 🐕.
