**Hi! I'm Derrick (施德睿)**

I'm a software developer and a photographer based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. I build things and take pictures. I'm a graduate student in NTHU's IMPISA program and I'm a part of [AI Lab](http://ai.cs.nthu.edu.tw/).  Currently I'm a part-time software developer for Aillio, a coffee startup based in Taipei.

In my free time, I like to roam to capture moments. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have a wonderful little Siamese cat, Lola 🐈 (I also enjoy taking pictures of her too).

You can find me online on my handle ***@derrxb***. But here are a few links that you might be interested in:

> * [GitHub](https://github.com/derrxb) [Here] - Projects I'm currently working on
> * [Derrxb.com](https://derrxb.com) - My personal website for my travels and (hopefully) software development thoughts

你好，我是施德睿。

我住在台灣新竹市。我是軟件工程師和攝影師。我是清大學生。

有空的時後，我喜歡旅行，照相，和看電影。
