**Hi! I'm Derrick (施德睿)**

I'm a software developer and a photogrrapher based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. I build things and take pictures. I'm graduate student in NTHU's IMPISA program and I'm a part of AI Lab.  Currently I'm a part-time software developer for Aillio, a coffee startup based in Taipei.

In my free time, I like to roam to capture moments. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have a wonderful little Siamese cat, Lola 🐈 (I also enjoy taking pictures of her too).
