**Hi! I'm Derrick (施德睿)**

I'm a software developer and a photographer based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. I build things and take pictures. I'm a graduate student in NTHU's IMPISA program and I'm a part of [AI Lab](http://ai.cs.nthu.edu.tw/).  Currently I'm a part-time software developer for Aillio, a coffee startup based in Taipei.

In my free time, I like to roam to capture moments. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have a wonderful little Siamese cat, Lola 🐈 (I also enjoy taking pictures of her too).

You can find me online on my handle ***@derrxb***. But here are a few links that you might be interested in:
